## Markdown

If a Markdown file (*.md) is selected in Windows Explorer or total Commander:

* NVDA+Alt+Space, Views the file in the NVDA browser.
* NVDA+Alt+Shift+Space, Saves the file in HTML format.

## In all browsers 

* Use Ctrl+NVDA+f4 to show page URL, press twice, copy to clipboard.

## Microsoft Outlook in version 13 or higher

* Empty folders are usually recognized.
* With Ctrl+Alt+j you jump to the first folder below the inbox, which contains unread emails.
* Shift+Ctrl+Alt+i, Saves the current folder as Folder 1
* Shift+Alt+i, Go to folder 1

A further 4 folders can be defined and jumped to. The folders can also be in another account. The gestures for this are still freely available.
